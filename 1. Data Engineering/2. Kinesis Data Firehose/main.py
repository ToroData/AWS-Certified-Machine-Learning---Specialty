"""
Main script for training a machine learning model and logging progress to AWS Kinesis.

This script performs the following tasks:
1. Loads and preprocesses data from a specified path.
2. Trains a machine learning model for a number of epochs.
3. Evaluates the model at each epoch and logs the results to an AWS Kinesis Data Stream.
4. Saves the trained model to a specified file path.

Dependencies:
- src.data_preprocessing: Contains functions for loading and preprocessing data.
- src.model_training: Contains functions for training, evaluating, and saving the model.
- src.kinesis_logging: Contains function for logging data to AWS Kinesis.
- src.config: Contains configuration settings for file paths and hyperparameters.

Configuration:
- `data_path`: Path to the CSV file containing the data.
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `kinesis_stream_name`: Name of the AWS Kinesis Data Stream for logging.
- `model_path`: Path to save the trained model.

Usage:
Ensure that the configuration file and necessary dependencies are properly set up before running this script.

Example:
    $ python main_script.py

    Main function to orchestrate the model training pipeline and logging.

    This function performs the following steps:
    1. Load and Prepare Data:
       - Loads the data from the file path specified in the configuration.
       - Preprocesses the data to prepare it for model training and evaluation.

    2. Train the Model and Log Results:
       - Trains the model for a number of epochs as specified in the configuration.
       - Evaluates the model's accuracy at each epoch.
       - Sends a log entry with the epoch number and accuracy to an AWS Kinesis Data Stream.
       - Prints the response from Kinesis to the console.

    3. Save the Trained Model:
       - Saves the trained model to the file path specified in the configuration.

    Configuration:
    - `CONFIG['data_path']`: Path to the CSV file containing the data.
    - `CONFIG['epochs']`: Number of training epochs.
    - `CONFIG['kinesis_stream_name']`: Name of the AWS Kinesis Data Stream for logging.
    - `CONFIG['model_path']`: Path to save the trained model.

    Dependencies:
    - `src.data_preprocessing`: For functions to load and preprocess data.
    - `src.model_training`: For functions to train, evaluate, and save the model.
    - `src.kinesis_logging`: For logging data to AWS Kinesis.
    - `src.config`: For configuration settings.

    Example Usage:
        If this script is run directly, it will execute the `main` function.
        Ensure that all necessary configurations are set in the `CONFIG` and required modules are installed.
